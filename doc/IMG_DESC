It's a paletized format. Not really standard, for example 64000bytes
img files are purely raw data, 320x200 bytes, no description of the size,
no description of the colors. You have to pick yourself the palette. Some
other .img files include some information in a 12 bytes header which goes :

2bytes		???		0xC0 (192), 0
2bytes		???		1, 0
2bytes		width		125
2bytes		height		198
2bytes		??		0
1byte		???		0xAE (174), 0
1byte		??		0x60 (96), 0xFA (250)
