This looks like a sky description.

Looks like the first 24k+256 bytes are somewhat of a palette. With 
palettes of 768 bytes, we can assume we have 32 different palettes.

With 32 palettes, we can also assume we have 32 differents times in the day.

Starts at 24832:
The next part is either thumbnails or maybe clouds ? Those blocks seems
to be 16 x 64 (1024bytes)
(520kB)

Starts at 549120:
The rest seems to be the same piece of sky at different hours
of the day. 512px wide I assume, probably 220px high.
64 * 512 * 220 = 7208960
