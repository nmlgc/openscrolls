<h1>Daggerfall SKY File Format</h1>
March 7, 2004

<p>This is the format for the SKY##.DAT files that come with TES: 
Daggerfall. They contain the backdrop images and palettes used in 
the outdoor game environment.</p>
					

<h2 id="overall">Overall SKY Format</h2>

The overall file is divided into three sections:
<pre>
	Bytes      1 -   24832	<a href="#pals">Main palettes</a>
	Bytes  24833 -  549120	<a href="#fadein">Fade-in lookup tables</a>
	Bytes 549121 - 7758080	<a href="#images">Sky images</a>
</pre>


<h2 id="pals">Main Palette Section</h2>

<p>The palette section consists of 32 records. The format of each record 
is identical to that used by COL files:</p>
<pre>
	Bytes  1 -   4	INT32	File size (always 776)
	Bytes  5 -   6	INT16	Format ID (always 0xB123)
	Bytes  7 -   8	INT16	Format version (always 0)
	Bytes  9 - 776	CHARS	256-color, 24-bit RGB palette
</pre>

<p>Note that each palette is a full 24-bit palette, with values in the range 0..255 
for every color channel; no bit-shift or multiplication ops are necessary.</p>


<h2 id="fadein">Object Fade-In Lookup Tables</h2>

<p>These lookup tables are used when "fading in" objects from beyond 
the edge of the player's visibility range. There are 32 sets (one 
for each palette) of 64 tables of 256 bytes each.</p>

<p>Rather than explain it in plain English, I am going to throw some 
heavily-commented pseudocode at you:</p>
<pre>
	for each visible surface do
	  Z = SomeFunctionOf(SurfacePos, PlayerSightRange)
	  /* Z = surface's distance from the edge of the 
	   * player's visibility range. Z of 0 means the 
	   * surface is right at the edge. Z of 63 means 
	   * the surface is not faded at all. */
	  for each pixel do
	    PixelColor = Shifted(PaletteNumber, Z, PixelColor)
	    /* Shifted(Set, Table, Color) effectively returns 
	     * the value of the byte at (zero-based) offset
	     * (24832 + (Set * 16384) + (Table * 256) + Color)
	     * in the current SKY##.DAT file. */
	  loop
	loop
</pre>


<h2 id="images">Sky Images</h2>

<p>There are 64 images in the file. Each image is 512 by 220 pixels 
in size, and is stored in uncompressed 8-bit-per-pixel format. 
The images are divided into two sets:</p>
<pre>
	Images  0 - 31	Series with no sun.
	Images 32 - 63	Series with sun.
</pre>
<p>The images in each set are assigned one of the 32 palette records 
in ascending order (i.e., the first image in each set uses the first 
palette record, the second one uses the second palette, and so on).</p>

<p>Each image is used for only half the sky; initially, images from the 
first series (0-31) are assigned to the western sky, and image from 
the second (32-63) are used for the eastern sky. At noon, the set 
assignment is switched, and the sets are played backwards; this 
allows the effect of the sun rising in the east and setting in the 
west, without the need to store large images of the whole sky.</p>
