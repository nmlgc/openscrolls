<p align="center">March 29, 2007</p>

<p align="center" class="andux">(XHTMLized by <a href="#credits" title="Sean Weinmann">Andux</a>)</p>


<h2 align="center" id="overall">Overall VID Format</h2>

<p>The overall file is composed of a main header followed blocks of audio and video data.</p>

<pre>
	Bytes   1 -  15:	<a href="#header">Header</a>
	Bytes  16 - EOF: 	Various Blocks
		...
</pre>
<p>The type of block is identified by the first byte in the block.</p>
<pre>
	0x01 = <a href="#video">Video</a>, <a href="#x01">Compression #1</a>
	0x02 = <a href="#x02">Palette</a>
	0x03 = Video, <a href="#x03">Compression #2</a>
	0x04 = Video, <a href="#x04">Compression #3</a>
	0x14 = <a href="#x14">End of File</a>
	0x7C = <a href="#x7c">Audio, Start Frame</a>
	0x7D = <a href="#x7d">Audio</a>
</pre>


<h2 align="center" id="header">Header</h2>

<p>The header is always the first 15 bytes of the VID file.</p>
<pre>
	Bytes   1 -   3:	ASCII	Always "VID"
	Bytes   4 -   5:	INT16	Always 0x00 02 (512)
	Bytes   6 -   7:	INT16	Number of Frames
	Bytes   8 -   9:	INT16	Video Frame Width (256 or 320)
	Bytes  10 -  11:	INT16	Video Frame Height (200)
	Bytes  12 -  13:	INT16	Global Delay value?
	Bytes  14 -  15:	INT16	0x0E 00 (14) in all DF VIDs
</pre>


<h2 align="center" id="x02">Palette Block - 0x02</h2>

<p>This usually only appears immediately after the header.</p>
<pre>
	Bytes  1  -  1 :	CHAR8	Block Type (0x02)
	Bytes  2  - 769:	RGB	256-color VGA palette. Each palette entry is
	                		composed of 3 triplets (R/G/B) ranging in 
	                		value from 0 to 63.
</pre>
<p>Experimentation has revealed that the Daggerfall engine does corectly 
interpret palette blocks inserted later in the file, though none of 
the videos included with the game make use of this functionality.</p>


<h2 align="center" id="x7c">Audio Block - 0x7C</h2>

<p>This is usually the first audio block in the file.</p>
<pre>
	Bytes   1 -   1:	CHAR8	Block Type (0x7C).
	Bytes   2 -   3:	INT16	Unknown; always 0.
	Bytes   4 -   4:	CHAR8	Sound Blaster DAC init value (usually 0xA6)
	Bytes   5 -   6:	INT16	Audio block data length
	Bytes   7 - ???:	AUDIO	8-bit audio data
</pre>
<p>The DAC init value corresponds to the audio sample rate as follows:</p>
<pre>
	InitVal = 256 - (1000000 DIV SampleRate)
	SampleRate = 1000000 / (256 - InitVal)
</pre>


<h2 align="center" id="x7d">Audio Block - 0x7D</h2>

<p>The audio blocks hold the audio for each frame.</p>
<pre>
	Bytes   1 -   1:	CHAR8	Block Type (0x7D).
	Bytes   2 -   3:	INT16	Audio block data length
	Bytes   4 - ???:	AUDIO	8-bit audio data
</pre>


<h2 align="center" id="video">Video Block - 0x01, 0x03 and 0x04</h2>

<p>The basic structure of the video blocks is all the same:</p>
<pre>
	Bytes   1 -   1:	CHAR8	Block Type (0x01, 0x03 or 0x04).
	Bytes   2 -   3:	INT16	<a href="#re02">Display time</a> (in 60ths of a second)
	Bytes   4 - ???:	VIDEO	Compressed video data.
</pre>
<p>Each type of video block has a slightly different compression format 
(see below for details). Unfortunately there is no record size so you 
must completely parse the video data in order to find the next block.
<span class="andux">There is only one frame per block, so you can stop parsing video 
when InputByte == 0 or Bytes Copied >= (Frame Width * Frame Height).</span></p>

<p>It is important to note exactly how the video frames go together. 
Only the 0x03 video block actually contains a full frame of data. 
The 0x01 and 0x04 types only contain the pixels that have changed 
from the previous frame. Thus, generally in order to render any one 
frame you must also render all previous frames up to the first 0x03 
video block.</p>


<h3 align="center" id="x01">Video compression - 0x01</h3>

<p>The video data in a form of RLE compression with the following 
algorithim used for uncompression:</p>
<pre>
	InputByte = Read 1 Byte From File

	if ( InputByte >= 0x80 )
		RunLength = InputByte - 0x80
		Skip RunLength Pixels in the Video Frame

	else if ( InputByte == 0 )
		End of Video Frame

	else 
		RunLength = InputByte
		Read RunLength Bytes From File and Copy to Frame
	endif
</pre>


<h3 align="center" id="x03">Video compression - 0x03</h3>

<p>This is usually the first video block in the file and contains a 
full frame of video in regular RLE format. The basic uncompressing 
algorithm is:</p>
<pre>
	InputByte = Read 1 Byte From File

	/* RLE compression */
	if (InputByte >= 0x80) 
		NumberofBytes = InputByte - 0x80
		InputByte = Read 1 Byte From File
		Add NumberofBytes of InputByte to Video Frame

	else if (InputByte == 0) /* Should never happen in 0x03 */
		End of Video Frame

	else 
		NumberofBytes = InputByte
		Read NumberofBytes from File and Copy to Video Frame
	endif
</pre>


<h3 align="center" id="x04">Video compression - 0x04</h3>

<p>This format has an extra header variable:</p>
<pre>
	Bytes   4 -   5:	INT16	Y-Offset. The video frame data 
	                	starts at this line in the frame.
</pre>
<p>What follows is the video frame data in the same format as the <a href="#x01">0x01</a> type.</p>


<h2 align="center" id="x14">End of File - 0x14</h2>

<p>This block always occupies the last byte the file.</p>
<pre>
	Bytes   1 -   1:	CHAR8	Block Type (0x14).
</pre>
<p class="andux">This is only included for completeness.</p>

<hr />
<h2 align="center" id="example">Programming Example</h2>

<p class="andux">For those of you (like me) who find it difficult to get your heads 
around a file format with specifications alone, here is a breakdown (in English) 
of the inner workings of a VID reader, based on my own audio/frame dumper app.
Hopefully, you will find it helpful.</p>


Be a good little programmer and initialize your variables:<ul>

	<li>VID Header:<ul>
		<li>Three (3) Bytes for confirming the file starts with "VID" (and a constant for comparison).</li>
		<li>One INT16 for reading that mysterious 512 (and maybe a const for comparison).</li>
		<li>One INT16 for the Frame Count.</li>
		<li>One INT16 for the Frame Width.</li>
		<li>One INT16 for the Frame Height.</li>
		<li>One INT16 for the Global Delay.</li>
		<li>One INT16 for Unknown Value 1.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>One (1) byte for the Block Type</li>

	<li>Palette Block:<ul>
		<li>768 bytes (or an array, whatever) for the 256-Color VGA Palette.</li>
	</ul></li>

	<li>Audio Block 0x7C:<ul>
		<li>One INT16 for Unknown Value 2.</li>
		<li>One (1) byte for the Playback Rate.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Both Audio Blocks:<ul>
		<li>One INT16 for the Audio Block Size.</li>
		<li>One big buffer (~16K to be safe) for the Audio Data (or a bunch of smaller ones).</li>
	</ul></li>

	<li>Video Block:<ul>
		<li>One INT16 for Unknown Value 2 (optional; you could use Audio Block Size for this, too).</li>
		<li>One INT16 for the Y-Offset (Block Type 4 only).</li>
		<li>One (1) byte for the Run Length.</li>
		<li>One (1) byte for the Pixel Value (Block Type 3 only).</li>
		<li>127 bytes for the Image Data.</li>
	</ul></li>

	<li>(Frame Width * Frame Height) bytes for the FrameBuffer (64K ought to be enough for anyone!).</li>
</ul>


Ensure the VID File exists, and open it.

<p>Read 3 ASCII bytes from the beginning of the VID File; if they read "VID", continue.<br />
Read an INT16; it should have the value 512.<br />
Read an INT16 containing the Frame Count.<br />
Read an INT16 containing the Frame Width.<br />
Read an INT16 containing the Frame Height.<br />
Read an INT16 containing the Global Delay.<br />
Read an INT16 containing Unknown Value 1.</p>

<p>Calculate FrameBuffer Size by multiplying Frame Width and Frame Height.</p>

Do the following:<ul> 
	<li>Read one byte containing the Block Type.</li>

	<li>If the Block Type has the value 2, then:<ul> 
		<li>Read 768 bytes containing the 256-Color VGA Palette.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Otherwise, if the Block Type has the value 124, then:<ul> 
		<li>Read or skip an INT16 containing Unknown Value 2.</li>
		<li>Read one byte containing the Playback Rate.</li>
		<li>Read an INT16 containing the Audio Block Size.</li>
		<li>Read (Audio Block Size) bytes of 8-bit, Unsigned Audio Data.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Otherwise, if the Block Type has the value 125, then:<ul> 
		<li>Read an INT16 containing the Audio Block Size.</li>
		<li>Read (Audio Block Size) bytes of 8-bit, Unsigned Audio Data.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Otherwise, if the Block Type has the value 1, 3, or 4, then:<ul> 
		<li>Read or skip an INT16 containing Unknown Value 2.</li>

		<li>If the Block Type has the value 4, then:<ul>
			<li>Read an INT16 containing the Y-Offset.</li>
			<li>Jump to offset (Y-Offset * Frame Width) in the FrameBuffer.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Otherwise, jump to the beginning of the FrameBuffer.</li>

		<li>Do the following:<ul>
			<li>Read one byte containing the Run Length.</li>

			<li>If the Run Length has a value greater than 127, then:<ul>
				<li>If the Block Type has the value 3, then:<ul>
					<li>Read one byte containing the Pixel Value.</li>
					<li>Copy the Pixel Value over the next (Run Length - 128) pixels in the FrameBuffer.</li>
				</ul></li>
				<li>Otherwise, just increment your offset in FrameBuffer by (Run Length - 128).</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>Otherwise, if the Run Length has a value greater than 0, then:<ul>
				<li>Read (Run Length) bytes containing the Image Data.</li>
				<li>Copy the Image Data over the next (Run Length) bytes of the FrameBuffer.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>Throughout all of this, you should ensure that you do not overflow the FrameBuffer.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Repeat until your offset in the FrameBuffer is equal to the FrameBuffer Size, or (Run Length) == 0.</li>

		<li>Copy the FrameBuffer to memory, screen, disk, or whatever.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Otherwise, if the Block Type has the value 20, then:<ul>
		<li>You have reached the end of the VID File.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Otherwise, if the Block Type has the value 0, and we just ended a frame, then:<ul>
		<li>Go back to the start of the loop (this is not a block, just a bit of format weirdness).</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Otherwise, you are horribly lost, and should print debug info and probably check with the user before attempting to continue.</li>
</ul>
Repeat until you reach the end of the VID File.


<p class="andux">Note that this is just the basic functionality for interpreting VID files.
In an actual player, you would probably want to cache the next couple KB or so of the file to 
improve speed on video blocks, and generally optimize the hell out of the code.</p>

<h3 id="re01">Re: DF movies</h3>

<blockquote><pre>Andux,

Had a comparison of your format versus mine - I'd split up my frames in a
kind of odd way - I'd been bundling the audio and video together and
decoding based upon that - but the same result was acheived. I had a feeling
there were some more similarities between frame types to be discovered.

Anyway, as payback - here's a couple of "unknowns" in your document for you.

In the header:
Bytes  12 -  13:	INT16	Unknown
In the video block:
Bytes   2 -   3:	INT16	Unknown value

These are both used to calculate the amount of time each frame should be
displayed (and presumably audio frame is heard). They are both little endian
format. The header delay value is added to the video block delay value to
produce the total time for the delay. So by doubling the header value in a
file, it halves the overall frame rate. Equally you can make adjustments to
the individual frames by modifying that value on a per frame basis.

Now - you'll be wanting to know what these "time delay" units are right?
Well - now we enter my approximation zone. To the best of what I've been
able to tell - these units should be 16 millisecond each. So, if the total
of header and frame delays is 0x0100 (which would be very high btw) then
delay should be 256 * 16  = 4096 milliseconds = about 4 seconds. Just don't
quote me on that 16 millisecond bit ;o)

Anyway - I'm tired and I've rambled enough - I realised I'd attached a
slightly old exe to my last mail - so the most current one is attached this
time.

Thanks again,
CC
</pre></blockquote>

<div class="andux">
<p>Looking at the format, it seems like each video frame is supposed to be
displayed for the length of the next audio block (i.e., until the next frame
overwrites it). Maybe the delay values are used to prevent audio skipping or
something (e.g., "Start working on the next frame after X milliseconds so
it's ready before the audio finishes.").</p>

<p>Correction: Each video frame is linked to the audio block immediately 
<em>before</em> it in the file. Comparing the results of CC's audio_block_size calculation 
(see below) to the actual DF videos confirms this.</p>

<p>Further update: After doing some calculations based on the new (relatively speaking)
<a href="#x7c">sample rate formulas</a>, I have determined that one delay unit is
equal to 1/60th of a second (or as close to it as possible, given all the wacky sample rates and integer division).
Thus, CC's formulas may be adapted to other sample rates as follows:</p>

<pre>
	AudioGranuleSize = SampleRate DIV 60

	AudioBlockSize = (HeaderDelay + FrameDelay) * AudioGranuleSize
	FrameDisplayTimeInSeconds = (HeaderDelay + FrameDelay) / 60
</pre>

<p>Note, however, that I have not yet had a chance to test this with the Daggerfall player.</p></div>


<h3 id="re02">Notes for Andux - re: Skynet .vid file formats.</h3>

From: Corroded Coder<br />
Date: January 11, 2004

<ul><li>
many contain multiple palette blocks (which checks my code nicely).
</li><li>
some headers contain 0x000A instead of 0x000E (for the remaining unknown word) - I have been unable to identify what this indicates ( could indicate multiple palette blocks - but if so the Daggerfall player ignores it).
</li><li>
I've finally worked out the math for the video delay values. Size of audio_block_size = (header_delay + frame_delay) * 185. This is *exact* (for all except the final frame which is only partial). So frame time for no-audio = ( (header_delay + frame_delay) * 185)/11025. (from my memory). This would of course be affected by a change in audio speed (from 0xA6)
</li><li>
There are some Skynet videos without any audio.
</li></ul>
