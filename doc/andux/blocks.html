<h1>BLOCKS.BSA</h1>

A typical BSA file with a filename type directory at the end with 1295 
records.  There are three types of records which are contained in this
BSA file which can be derived from their directory filenames.
<dl>
<dt>*.RMB</dt><dd>Most records are this type of variable length record. 920 files.</dd>
<dt>*.RDB</dt><dd>Variable length record. 187 files.</dd>
<dt>*.RDI</dt><dd>Seems to be a fixed length record of 512 bytes. Appears to contain only 00's and 01's. 187 files.</dd>
<dt>FOO</dt><dd>One record is not any real data but actually a DOS directory listing of someone's directory (with a hard drive named FireBall).</dd>

	<h2>RMB Files</h2>
<div style="margin: 0px 1em;">
	<h3 id="rmblayout">General File Layout</h3>

  The RMB file is the most common type in the blocks file and is organized as
  follows:
<pre>
	RMB File	
		Fixed Length Data (FLD)		(6776 bytes total)
			Record Counts		(3 bytes)
			Block Positions		(640 bytes)
			Section1		(832 bytes)
			Section2		(128 bytes)
			Block Data Sizes	(128 bytes)
			Small Maps		(520 bytes)
			Automap 		(4096 bytes))
			Filenames		(429 bytes)
		...RMB Block Data...		(Variable)
			Outside Header		(17 bytes)		
			  3D Object Data	(66 byte records)
			  Flat Object Data	(17 byte records)
			  Data Section3		(16 byte records)
			  People Data		(17 byte records)
			  Door Data		(19 byte records)
			Inside Header		(17 bytes)
			  3D Object Data	(66 byte records)
			  Flat Object Data	(17 byte records)
			  Data Section3		(16 byte records)
			  People Data		(17 byte records)
			  Door Data		(19 byte records)
			Extra Byte		(1 byte, optional)
		...RMB 3D Objects...		(66 byte records)
		...RMB Flat Objects...		(17 byte records)
</pre>
  Note that in the RMB block data section there are two repeating sections.
  The first section contains data for the outside, or main, object, such
  as the exterior of a house or tavern.  This section usually just has one
  3D Object Data section which is the main 3D object for locations.  The 
  following section holds the data for the interior object, such as inside 
  a house or tavern.  Typically this section holds much more information
  than the previous one.


		<h3 id="rmbfld">Fixed Length Data (FLD)</h3>
<div style="margin: 0px 1em;">
  Each block record appears to begin with 0x1A78 (6776) bytes of fixed length
  data.  This data can be subdivided into the follow records.
<pre>
		FLD Record Count	(3 bytes)
		FLD SubBlock Positions	(640 bytes)
		FLD Section1		(832 bytes)
		FLD Section2		(128 bytes)
		FLD Block Data Sizes	(128 bytes)
		FLD Small Maps		(520 bytes)
		FLD Automap 		(4096 bytes)
		FLD Filenames		(429 bytes)
</pre>
  In general, each of these subsections can be subdivided into 32 further 
  subrecords as described in each section below.


			<h4 id="rmbfldrecc">FLD Record Counts</h4>

  The first 3 bytes in the fixed length data give the number of various
  records which appear later on in the block record.

	[Byte 0]  byte NumSubRecords1;
		Values range from 0 to 28 with a total of 9005 subrecords1 in 
		the blocks file.
	[Byte 1]  byte NumSubRecords2;
		Values range from 0 to 93 with a total of 9153 subrecords2
		in the blocks file.
	[Byte 2]  byte NumSubRecords3;
		Values range from 0 to 74 with a total of 11732 subrecords3
		in the blocks file.


			<h4 id="rmbfldblockpos">FLD Block Positions </h4>

  The fixed length data header is found at offsets 0x03 to 0x282 (642) bytes
  in the FLD for a total of 0x280 (640 bytes). It contains 32 records of
  0x1A (20) bytes each which contain the positions for each of the sub-blocks
  in the file.
<pre>
		[Bytes  0 - 3]	long XPos1;
		[Bytes  4 - 7]	long ZPos1;
			Unknown what these coordinates are for. Possibly the 
			subblock size?
		[Bytes  8 -11]  long XPos2;
		[Bytes  12-15]  long ZPos2;
			Give the position of the subblock in map coordinates.
		[Bytes 16-19]	long YPos2;
			Unknown.
</pre> 

			<h4 id="rmbfldsec1">FLD Section1</h4>

  The fixed length data section1 is found at offsets 0x283 (643) to 
  0x5C2 (1474), just after the FLD header, for a total of 0x340 (832) bytes.
  It seems to contain 32 records of 0x1A (26) bytes each.  It seems to
  be very similar to the location post-records found in MAPS.BSA.
	

			<h4 id="rmbfldsec2">FLD Section2</h4>

  The fixed length data section2 is found at offsets 0x5C3 (1475) to 
  0x642 (1602), just after the FLD Section1, for a total of 0x80 (128) bytes.
  It should contain 32 records of 4 bytes each. 


			<h4 id="rmbfldsizes">FLD Block Data Sizes</h4>

  This section is found at offsets 0x5C3 (1475) to 0x6C2 (1730), just after
  the FLD Section2, for a total of 0x80 (128) bytes. It contains 32 records
  of 4 bytes each and represents the record sizes of the Block Data records
  which appear later in the file.
<pre>
		[Bytes 0-127]	long Sizes[32];
</pre>

			<h4 id="rmbfldsmap">FLD Small Map Data</h4>

  The fixed length data section3 is found at offsets 0x6C3 (1731) to 
  0x8CD (2253), just after the FLD Block Data Sizes, for a total of 
  0x208 (520) bytes. It appears to contain an 8 byte header followed by
  two sections of 256 bytes each.  
<pre>	
	[Bytes   0-  7]	char Header[8];
	[Bytes   8-263]	char TextureInfo[16][16];
		See description which follows. Contains modified texture
	     	image indices to use.
	[Bytes 264-519]	char ObjectInfo[16][16];
		Currently unknown.
</pre>
  The first 256 bytes after the header shows some interesting designs when 
  viewed as a 16x16 image and probably indicates the textures to display on
  the land under the block.  The format for the texture info bytes is a bit
  field described as follows:
<pre>
	[Bits 0-5]  int	TextureIndex;	(6 bits)
		This value, ranging from 0-63, gives the new texture index to
		display. The texture file to use will depend on the current 
		location (desert, temperate, etc...) and the time (raining,
		summer, winter, etc...).  
	[Bit    6]  int RotateTexture;	(1 bit)
		Might be a flag indicating that the texture should be rotated
		90 degrees so that the width becomes its height and vice-versa.
		This allows reuse of textures rather than duplicating them in
		the texture file.
	[Bit    7]  int FlipTexture;	(1 bit)
		Appears to be a flag indicating that the texture should be
		flipped in both the X and Y directions so that its last pixel
		becomes its first.
</pre>
  The last 256 bytes looks more like a starry night and could indicate how to
  place scenery around the block, but its purpose is unknown currently. It may
  be a bit field like the first 256 byte section.
  

			<h4 id="rmbfldthumb">FLD Automap</h4>

  The fixed length data section4 is found at offsets 0x8CB (2251) to 
  0x18CA (6346), just after the FLD Small Map Data, for a total of 0x1000 (4096)
  bytes. It contains a 64x64 bitmap which is seen when you look at the 
  automap while in town.  The bitmap also contains extra information which
  is not displayed.  The general pixel values are as follows:
<pre>	
		0x00 	Background, transparent
		0x03	Store? (orange)
		0x10	Taverns (green)
		0x12	Residence? (gray)
		0x13	Residence (gray)
		0x14	Residence? (gray)
		0xE0	Special Item? (not displayed)
		0xFA	Object (not displayed)
		0xFB	Object (not displayed)
</pre>
  It is not known what the three types of residences represent.  The bitmap
  probably does not control where things appear but was most likely used as
  as development tool.


			<h4 id="rmbfldfiles">FLD Filenames</h4>

  The list of component filenames is found at offset 0x18CB (6347) to
  0x1A77 (6775), just after the FLD Section4, for a total of 0x1AD (429)
  bytes. Filenames are 13 bytes which includes the terminating NULL
  character (regular 8.3 syntax). There may be NULL filenames at the end
  of the list.  The first filename is always the block record file followed
  by 32 other filenames.
<pre>
	[Bytes  0- 12]	char BlockFilename[13];
	[Bytes 13-428]  char Filenames[13][32];
</pre>
</div>
		<h3 id="rmbb">Block Data</h3>
<div style="margin: 0px 1em;">
  Following the FLD section there are usually one or more blocks of block
  data which can be described as follows:
<pre>
	Header			(17 bytes)	     }	Exterior data like that
	  3D Object Data	(66 byte records)    }  for a house or tavern. 
	  Flat Object Data	(17 byte records)    }  Usually contains just 
	  Data Section3		(16 byte records)    }  one 3D object 
	  People Data		(17 byte records)    }	
	  Door Data		(19 byte records)    }
	Header			(17 bytes)	   	} Interior data like 	
	  3D Object Data	(66 byte records)	} that for the inside
	  Flat Object Data	(17 byte records)	} of a house or tavern.
	  Data Section3		(16 byte records)	} Contains much more 
	  People Data		(17 byte records)	} data than the previous
	  Door Data		(19 byte records)	} section.
	Extra Byte		(Optional 1 byte, 0x96)
</pre>
  Some RMB files do not have any subrecords, they simply end after their FLD
  Filenames.  In some subrecords there is an extra byte, 0x96, after the end
  of the record.  It can be identified by the length of the subrecord1 as
  given in the fixed length data section for the RMB file.


		<h3 id="rmbbheader">Block Header</h3>

  The header is always at the start of the block subrecord and appears to be
  always 0x11 (17) bytes in size.
<pre>
	[Byte      0]	unsigned char Num3DObjectRecords;
	[Byte      1]	unsigned char NumFlatObjectRecords;
	[Byte      2]	unsigned char NumSection3Records;
	[Byte      3]	unsigned char NumPeopleRecords;
	[Byte      4]	unsigned char NumDoorRecords;
		The number of records in each of the data sections which follow.
	[Bytes  5- 6]	short Unknown1;
	[Bytes  7- 8]	short Unknown2; (always non-zero)
	[Bytes  9-10]	short Unknown3;
	[Bytes 11-12]	short Unknown4; (always non-zero)
	[Bytes 13-14]	short Unknown5; (always non-zero)
	[Bytes 15-16]	short Unknown6; (always non-zero)
		The data suggests 3 pairs of shorts but it could be something
		entirely different.
</pre>

		<h3 id="rmbbobj">Block Record 3D Object Data</h3>

  The data follows immediately after the block header and is composed of 
  0x42 (66) byte records.  It contains the 3D object information for the
  current block.
<pre>
	[Bytes  0- 1]	short ObjectID1;
		Always non-zero in the range 1-511. 
	[Byte      2]	char  ObjectID2;
		Ranges from 0 to 63.
		The required 3DObject to load from Arch3D.BSA can be calculated
		from:
				ObjectID1 * 100 + ObjectID2

		This appears to give the directory ID for the appropiate object.
		It may be done this way if the objects are grouped by type in
		some fashion.
	[Byte      3]	char  Unknown1;
		Always non-zero, ranges from 3 to 67.
	[Bytes  4- 7]	long Unknown2;
		Non-zero only in 1297 of 236250 records. Seems to repeat within
		the same file.  Could be two or four seperate fields.
	[Bytes  8-13]	long Unknown3;
	[Bytes 14-17]	long Unknown4;
		Non-zero only in 272 of 236250 records. Seems to repeat within
		the same file.  Could be two or four seperate fields.
	[Bytes 16-19]	long NullValue1;
	[Bytes 20-23]	long NullValue2;
		Always 0 (confirmed).
	[Bytes 24-27]	long XPos1;	( -896256 to 761856 )
	[Bytes 28-31]	long YPos1;	(  -59136 to 273152 )
	[Bytes 32-35]	long ZPos1;	( -815360 to 705536 )
		Usually 0s, but some (370) records have what look like
		coordinates here with the given ranges.
	[Bytes 36-39]	long XPos2;	( -1088 to 1096 )
	[Bytes 40-43]	long YPos2;	(  -579 to  518 )
	[Bytes 44-47]	long ZPos2;	(  -512 to 1536 )
		Looks to be a coordinate of some form.  Values range as
		indicated above and is usually non-zero.
	[Bytes 48-51]	long NullValue3;
		Always 0 (confirmed).
	[Bytes 52-53]	short Angle;
		Almost always non-zero.  A value of 0x200 specifies that the
		object should be rotated 90 degrees about the Y-Axis (vertical).
	[Bytes 54-55]	short Unknown5;
		Always zero.
	[Bytes 56-59]	long NullValue6;
		Always 0 (confirmed).
	[Bytes 60-63]	long Unknown8;
		Only non-zero 16 times in one file (CUSTAA45.RMB) where it is
		0x200 (512).
	[Bytes 64-65]	short NullValue5;
		Always 0 (confirmed).
</pre>

		<h3 id="rmbbflats">Block Flat Objects</h3>

  This data follows immediately after the 3D Object Data in a Block Record 
  and is composed of 0x11 (17) byte records.  It contains information about
  flat objects in the block.  Flat objects are just that, merely textures 
  painted on planes which always face the viewer (called decals in Direct3D).
<pre>
	[Bytes 0- 3]		long XPos;
	[Bytes 4- 7]		long YPos;
	[Bytes 8-11]		long ZPos;
		Looks like coordinate of some form.
	[Bytes 12-12.6]		int SubImageIndex;	(7 bits)
		The subimage in the texture file to use for the flat.
	[Bytes 12.7-13.7]	int TextureIndex;	(9 bits)
		The texture file index to use.
	[Bytes 14-15]		short Unknown1;
		Usually non-zero (50%) and ranges from 0 to 65535. Might 
		indicate whether or not to display the flat.  The 'debuging'
		icons usually have a value of 0x0000 or 0xFFFF here.
	[Byte     16]		char  Unknown2;
		Usually non-zero (90%) and ranges from 0 to 105.
</pre>

		<h3 id="rmbbdata3">Block Data Section3</h3>

  This data follows immediately after the Flat Objects Data and is
  composed of 0x10 (16) byte records. It has an unknown purpose.
<pre>
	[Bytes  0- 3]	long XPos;
	[Bytes  4- 7]	long YPos;
	[Bytes  8-11]	long ZPos;
		Looks like coordinate of some form.
	[Byte     12]	char  Unknown1;
		Usually zero (99%) and ranges from 0 to 15.  Repeats mostly
 		in each file where it is present.
	[Byte     13]	char  Unknown2;
		Almost always non-zero and ranges from 0 to 45.
	[Bytes 14-15]	short Unknown3;
		Usually zero and ranges from 0 to 1292.  Lower 8 bits are
		always zero and upper 8 bits range from 0 to 7.
</pre>

		<h3 id="rmbbpeople">Block People Data</h3>

  This data follows immediately after the Section3 Data in a Block record and
  is composed of 0x11 (17) byte records.  Appears to be the same format as
  the Flat Object data.  It contains information about the people in a block.
<pre>
	[Bytes 0- 3]		long XPos;
	[Bytes 4- 7]		long YPos;
	[Bytes 8-11]		long ZPos;
		Looks like coordinate of some form.
	[Bytes 12-12.6]		int SubImageIndex;	(7 bits)
		The subimage in the texture file to use for the person.
	[Bytes 12.7-13.7]	int TextureIndex;	(9 bits)
		The texturefile to use for the person.
	[Bytes 14-15]		short NPCType;
		Seems to indicate the type of PC such as weaponsmith, barkeep.
		etc...
			0x0000 - Common person
			0x01FE - Barkeep
	[Byte     16]		char  Unknown3;
		Always non-zero and ranges from 1 to 45.
</pre>

		<h3 id="rmbbdoors">Block Door Data</h3>

  This data follows immediately after the People Data in a Block and is
  composed of 0x13 (19) byte records.  It seems to give information about
  the movable doors in a block.
<pre>	
	[Bytes 0- 3]	long XPos;
	[Bytes 4- 7]	long YPos;
	[Bytes 8-11]	long ZPos;
		Looks like coordinate of some form.
	[Bytes 12-13]	short Unknown1;
		Usually non-zero in the range 0 to 1536.
	[Bytes 14-15]	short Unknown2;
		Always non-zero in the range 90 to 98.
	[Bytes 16-17]	short Unknown3;
		Almost always non-zero in the range 0 to 7173.
	[Byte     18]	char  NullValue1;
		Always 0 (confirmed).
</pre>
</div>
		<h3 id="rmb3dobj">3D Objects</h3>

  These appear to be the same format as the RMB Blocks 3D Objects which
  are 0x42 (66) byte records.  It probably lists the 3D Objects which
  populate the exterior of a block, such as outside a house or tavern
  (fences, signs, etc...).


		<h3 id="rmbflats">Flat Objects</h3>
	
These appear to be the same format as the RMB Block Flat Objects
are 0x11 (17) byte records.  It probably gives the Flat Objects which
appear outside the given block, such as grass, bushes, etc...
</div>



	<h2 id="rdb">RDB Files</h2>
<div style="margin: 0px 1em;">
<p>RDB files are archived in Blocks.bsa. Each BSA filename begins with a
letter and is followed by a 7-digit decimal integer. (For example, 
"N0000019.RDB") These files are referenced in the dungeon records of 
Maps.bsa.</p>

<p>Each RDB file describes one dungeon 'block' in detail. Each block of 
dungeon is fits on a 2D grid with other blocks. There are two connecting
passages in each of the four cardinal directions, so there are eight paths
leading out of each block.</p>

		<h3 id="rdblayout">General Format</h3>
<pre>
	[Header]
	[3D Models Section]
	    [3D Model Records]

	    The width of the Object Root Section
	[Bytes 8-11]  long GridHeight;
	    The height of the Object Root Section
	[Bytes 12-15] unsigned long objectOffset;
	    The offset from the beginning of the RDB file to the Object
	    Root Section
	[Bytes 16-19] long Unknown4;
</pre>

		<h3 id="rdbmodels">3D Models Section (9000 bytes):</h3>

   First is a list of 750 3D Model Records of 8 bytes each. Unused records are
   filled with 0xFF. Each record has the following format.

<pre>
	[Bytes 0-4] char modelID[5];
	    a string containing the five-digit decimal representation of
	    the object's model ID
	    as seen in Arch3D.bsa
	    (not null-terminated)
	[Bytes 5-7] char objectType[3];
	    a short string possibly describing the type of object
	    (not null-terminated)
</pre>

	Next is another list of 750 records, but of only 4 bytes each.
	They seem to correspond to the 3D Model Records. The format of 
 	these bytes is unknown. Unused records are filled with 0x00.


		<h3 id="rdbobjs">Object Section:</h3>
<div style="margin: 0px 1em;">
   The Object Section is organized as follows:
<pre>	[Object Header Section]
	[Object Roots Section]
	[Object Data Section]
</pre>

			<h4 id="rdboheader">Object Header Section (512 bytes):</h4>
<pre>
	[Bytes 0-3]   long UnknownOffset;

	    of unknown purpose and format.
	[Bytes 4-7]   long Unknown1;
	[Bytes 8-11]  long Unknown2;
	[Bytes 12-15] long Unknown3;
	[Bytes 16-19] long FileSize;

	[Bytes 20-51] char Unknown4[32];
	    Seem to always be 0xFF
	[Bytes 52-55] char TagDAGR[4];
	    Seem to always be the character array "DAGR"
	[Bytes 56-511] char Unknown5[456];
	    Seem to be 0xFF
</pre>
			<h4 id="rdboroots">Object Roots Section:</h4>
<pre>
	[Bytes 0-...] long Offsets[]
</pre>
   The number of longs in the list is GridWidth*GridHeight. Each entry is an
   offset from the beginning of the file to an Object Record. Any negative 
   value indicates that no object data is present. The meaning of the grid 
   layout is unknown.

			<h4 id="rdbodata">Object Data Section:</h4>

   This section contains numerous records of various types, not in any 
   particular order.

<p>Each Object Record is a node of a doubly linked list. Use the
Object Roots Section to find the head of the list, and iterate
using the offsetNext and offsetPrev fields.</p>

	[Bytes 0-3]   long offsetNext;
	    The offset from the beginning of the RDB file to the next
	    Object Record. Any negative value indicates that there is no next item.
	[Bytes 4-7]   long offsetPrev;
	    The offset from the beginning of the RDB file to the previous Object Record.
	    Any negative value indicates that there is no previous item.
	[Bytes 8-11]  long xLoc;
	[Bytes 12-15] long yLoc;
	[Bytes 16-19] long zLoc;
	    These three values define the object's location in space.
	[Byte 20]        char objectType;
	    This can take on only these three values:
	        0x01: The object is a 3D model.
	        0x02: The object is a light source.
	        0x03: The object is a flat (including markers and monsters).
	[Bytes 21-24] long postRecordOffset;
	    The offset from the beginning of the RDB file to the
	    object's type-specific data.
</pre>
   Each object has a variable length post record, pointed to by
   postRecordOffset. The format of this record depends on the objectType.
<pre>
   Object Post Record, type 0x01 (3D Object) (23 bytes):
	[Bytes 0-3]   long xAngle;
	[Bytes 4-7]   long yAngle;
	[Bytes 8-11]  long zAngle;
	    the rotation angles about each axis
	[Bytes 12-13] short ModelIndex;
	    Indexes one of the 750 entries in the 3D Models Section.
	    This model is used for the object.
	[Bytes 14-17] long Unknown3; (ranges from 0 to 240)
	[Byte 18]     char Unknown4; (ranges from 0 to 108)   
	[Bytes 19-22] long ActionOffset;
	    Offset from the beginning of the RDB file to an Action
 	    Record, which contains additional information about how this
	    object behaves. If this value is -2 then no such record exists
	    for this object.

   Object Post Record, type 0x02 (Light Source) (10 bytes):
	[Bytes 0-3]   long Unknown1;
	[Bytes 4-7]   long Unknown2;
	[Bytes 8-9]   short Unknown3;
	    (Presumably, these values determine light intensity, range, etc.)

   Object Post Record, type 0x03 (Flat Object) (11 bytes):
	[Bytes 0-1] {
	    [bits 0-6]   int SubImageIndex;        (7 bits)
	    [bits 7-15]  int TextureIndex;        (9 bits)
	}
</pre>
   The texture to use, formatted as in the "RMB Block Flat
   Objects" section of an RMB file. The TextureIndex identifies
   the texture file and the SubImageIndex identifies the image
   within the texture file.
<pre>
	[Bytes 2-10]    char Unknown1[9];

		<h3 id="rdbaction">Action Record (10 Bytes):</h3>

   3D objects may point to an Action Record in ActionOffset.
<pre>
	[Bytes 0-4] char DataEntry[5];
	[Bytes 5-8] long TargetOffset;
	    The offset from the beginning of the RDB file to the Object
	    Record describing this action's target, negative if there is no target.
	[Byte 9]    char Type;
	    Probably affects how the DataEntry field is interpreted.
	    Ranges from 0 to 100, but most entries use these values:
	        0x00: Probably used to indicate no action.
	        0x01: Object Translation
	        0x08: Object Rotation
</pre>
<p>The target object (and the target object of its action, etc.) is
activated simultaneously with this object. In this way targets can be
chained together for several simultaneous effects.</p>

   Both Rotation and Translation actions format the DataEntry
   field in this way:
<pre>
	[Byte 0]       char Axis;
	    Takes on values ranging from 1 to 99, but most entries
	    use these values:
	        0x01: negative x
	        0x02: positive x
	        0x03: negative y
	        0x04: positive y
	        0x05: negative z
	        0x06: positive z
	    (Maybe a bit field?)
	[Bytes 1-2] unsigned short Duration;
	    Determines how long the object takes to reach its destination.
	[Bytes 3-4] unsigned short Delta;
	    The amount to move along/around the specified axis.
</pre>
Rotations rotate about the Axis while translations move along them.

<p>Doors do not appear to use the Action Record. It is not
known whether teleporting walls use it. Switches, levers, and
moving platforms appear to use it.</p>

<p>For example, in Privateer's Hold there is a switch next to a platform
with a throne on it. Flipping the switch invokes the switch's action,
which rotates it into the flipped position. That action targets the
platform, which makes it rise. The platform's action targets the throne,
which also rises. All these are performed simultaneously.</p>
