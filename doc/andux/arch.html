<h1>ARCH3D.BSA</h1>

The file is a typical BSA file with a 0x0200 directory of 0x280B records (10251) at the end. 
Each BSA record contains the information for one 3D object.

<h2 id="objrec">3D Object Records</h2>

<p>The following description has been tested on all the 3D Objects contained
in Arch3D.BSA and appears to be sound.  There are two records which have 
some problems (offsets 0x008B8D58 and 0x013274C6) and don't follow the
known format of the other 10249 records.  They have a large section of
repeating bytes just after the 3D object header and their Data2 section
is not the standard.  These records could very well be corrupt or not 
used or of a special, undiscovered, format.</p>

<p>Each BSA record contains the information for one 3D object. Note that each
record appears to be _similar_ to the .3D file format used in Battlespire. 
One difference is that here the .3D files are contained in one big file, 
while in Battlespire they are in individual files. Records range from 212
to 81394 bytes in size.  The basic record layout is as follows:</p>
<pre>
	3D Object Header (64 Bytes)
		Always the first 64 bytes in the record.  See the header
		section below for detail format and information.
	Unknown Data		
		Two files have strange sections of repeating bytes between
		the record header and point data. Usually, though, the point
		data follows starting at byte 64.
	Point Data
		Contains the point data as given by the number of points 
		previously read.  Each point is composed of 3 signed long
		integers, (X, Y, Z) for 12 bytes per point. Use the PointOffset
		variable in the header to get the start of the point data.
	PlaneData
		See the Plane Data Record section below.  There is one record
		for each plane given by the PlaneCount variable.  Use the
		PlaneOffset variable in the header to get the start of the
		plane data.
	Normal? Data Section
		Appears to have XYZ 12 bytes triplets again with the number of
		records equal to the number of planes.  This appears to be the
		normals of the planes but not entire confirmed. The offset to
		this data is also in the header.
	Offset1 Data Section
		This section is usually all 0x00's, but the size indicates it
		should have a record size of 24 bytes with the number of
		records equal to the number of planes. The offset to the start
		of this data is also in the header.
	Offset2 Data Section
		The number of records in this section is given in the object
		header.	The basic format of each record is as follows:
		   [Bytes 0-15]		long Numbers[4];
			Looks like 3 or 4 coordinates.
		   [Bytes 16-17]	short NumSubRecords;
			Gives the number of 6 bytes sub-records which follow.
		   [Bytes 18...]	char SubRecords[6][]
			The variable number of sub record data.
		This data finishes off the object record data.  The offset
		to the start of this data and the number of records the section
		contains is in the object header.
</pre>
  Note that while most 3D objects have this format, some have the sections 
  mixed up slightly (i.e., the data1 section comes before the points).  One
  should use the offset information in the object header to determine where
  each section starts.


<h2 id="objheader">3D Object Header</h2>

  The header is always the first 64 bytes in a 3D object record.
<pre>
  	[Bytes 0-3]	char Version[4] = "v2.7"; (or "v2.6" or "v2.5")
		Appears to be a version number or record identifier. Most of
		the records have v2.7, though 135 have v2.6 and 9 have v2.5.
		Note that the trailing NULL character is not included.  It is
		currently unknown what differences the various version records
		have, although it appears to be minor.
	[Bytes 4-7]	long PointCount;
		Gives the number of points contained in the 3D object.  Each
		point consists of 3 long integers (X, Y, Z) for a total of 
		12 bytes per point.  Point counts range from 3 to 1010.
	[Bytes 8-11]	long PlaneCount;
		This gives the number of planes/faces in the 3D object. Plane
		counts range from 1 to 712.
	[Byte  12-15]	long Unknown1;
		Has a wide range of values, generally non-zero.
	[Bytes 16-23]   char NullValue1[8];
		Always 0x00 bytes (confirmed).
	[Bytes 24-27]	long Data1Offset;
	[Bytes 28-31]	long Data2Offset;
		Appear to be offsets from the start of an object record
		Offset1 is always non-zero and Offset2 is zero only 3 times
		(confirmed).
	[Bytes 32-35]	long NumData2Records;
		Usually non-zero and less than 0x0010 (maximum around 212).
		Appears to be the number of records pointed to by Offset2.
	[Bytes 36-37]	short Unknown3;
		A wide range of repeating values.
	[Bytes 38-39]	short Unknown4;
		Usually 0x0000 or less than 0x0010 (maximum of 0x0068).
	[Bytes 40-43]	long NullValue3;
	[Bytes 44-47]	long NullValue4;
		Always 0x00000000 (confirmed).
	[Bytes 48-51]	long PointOffset;
		Almost always 0x00000040 but also takes on the values
			0x00000000 (strange?)
			0x00000178
			0x00001510
			0x000017F8
		The offset from the start of the object record to the start of
		the point data.
	[Bytes 52-55]	long NormalOffset;
		Offset from the record origin to the next byte after the end of
		the plane data. Always non-zero (confirmed).
	[Bytes 56-59]	long Unknown6;
		Always 0x00000000 except for 19 records which it has a number
		of values from 0x000000F4 to 0x000001FC. Possibly offset?
	[Bytes 60-63]   long PlaneOffset;
		Offset from start of object to the plane/face data.
</pre>	

<h2 id="planedata">Plane Data Record Section</h2>

  This is a sub-record of the 3D Object Record. Each plane record is 
  (8 + (PlanePointCount*8)) bytes in size. Some of the variables are bit
  fields written out as [Bytes 2-3.1] which would be a 9 bit field.
<pre>
	[Byte 0]	unsigned char PlanePointCount; (8 bits)
		The number of points which makes up the plane. This value
		ranges from 0x00 to 0x18 (24).
	[Byte 1]	char Unknown1;	(8 bits)
		Usually 0x00 for most plane records (about 2% are non-zero).
		Values range from 0x00 to 0xFF although most are repeating 
		values in the 0x00 to 0x40 range.
	[Bytes 2-2.6]	unsigned short SubImageIndex;	(7 bits)
		The subimage index in the texture file (0 to 127).
	[Bytes 2.7-3.7]	unsigned short TextureIndex;	(9 bits)
		The texture file index (0 to 474). 
	[Bytes 4-7] 	long Unknown4;
		Almost always 0x00000000, 0x00010000, 0x00010001, or 0x00010002 
		and rarely a wide range of other values.  Probably two short 
		values.
	[Bytes 8...]	PlanePointSubRecords
		For each point in the PlanePointCount variable, there is 8 bytes
		of data.
			[Bytes 0-3] 	long PointOffset;
			   v2.7:This gives the offset of the point used from the
				beginning of the point data. In other words,
				divide by 12 to get the point index. This is 
				confirmed for all v2.7 objects except for one
				which is strange (offset 0x013274C6).
			   v2.6:Appears to be the same as v2.7.
			   v2.5:The point offset is a multiple of 4 and appears
				to be the offset to the actual XYZ coordinate
				of the point.  To get the point index, divide
				by 4 (unconfirmed).
			[Bytes 4-5]	short TextureU;
			[Bytes 6-7]	short TextureV;
				Specifies the texture UV coordinates for the
				point.  See Appendix E for a complete description
				of how Daggerfall handles UV texture coordinates.
</pre>

<h2 id="objdir">Object Directory</h2>

  The object directory is at the end of the file and gives the record lengths
  of all the 3D object records (the usual 0x0200 type BSA directory map).
  There is also a long value associated with each record which, for most
  entries, is unique (all but 25 of 10251 records have unique values in the
  directory).


<h2 id="special">Special Objects</h2>

  The following list of objects in the ARCH3D file have special mention.
<dl>
<dt>Object 4722 (0x8B8D58)</dt>
<dd>		This v2.6 3D object has a truncated, or different, Data2
		section which does not conform with the known format.</dd>
<dt>Object 7614 (0x13274C6)</dt>
<dd>		This v2.7 object has an invalid offset to the Data2
		section (it points to the middle of the data1 section).</ff>
</dl>
