<p>This is a description of the format of the various .BSA files found in the
ARENA2 directory of Elder Scrolls:Daggerfall by Bethesda.  The information
here is not complete or 100% percent accurate, although the basic formats
appears to be well understood.  For more information, corrections, or

	<h2 id="gen">General BSA Files</h2>

<p>There are five BSA files in Daggerfall's ARENA2 directory (ARCH3D, MAPS,
MONSTER, MIDI, and BLOCKS). Although they contain different data, their
overall structure is the same. This format has been derived from all these
five files.  The following description appears to be complete.</p>

<div style="margin: 0px 1em;">
	<h3 id="layout">General File Layout</h3>
<ul>
	<li>BSA Header</li> 	
	<li>...BSA Records...</li>
	<li>BSA Directory</li>
</ul>


	<h3 id="header">BSA Header</h3>

This is the first 4 bytes found at the start of a BSA file and gives
information about the BSA directory at the end of the file.
<pre>
	[Bytes 0-1] short DirectoryCount;
		Gives the number of entries in the directory at the end of the 
		file.
	[Bytes 2-3] short DirectoryType; 
		Gives the type of directory at the end of the BSA file (See
		BSA Directory below).
			0x0100 = Directory has records of 18 bytes in size
				 consisting of a 14 byte filename and a long
				 record length.
			0x0200 = Directory has records of 8 bytes in size
				 consisting of long ID and a long record size.
</pre>

	<h3 id="records">BSA Records</h3>

This data will depend on the actual BSA file.  The basic contents for the
five known BSA files are as follows:
<dl>
<dt>ARCH3D</dt>
	<dd>3D Object Information</dd>
<dt>BLOCKS</dt>
	<dd>Dungeon/town block information</dd>
<dt>MAPS</dt>
	<dd>Location information (towns, dungeon, houses, temples, etc...)</dd>
<dt>MONSTER</dt>
	<dd>Monster data (no images)</dd>
<dt>MIDI</dt>
	<dd>HMI formatted music</dd>
</dl>

	<h3 id="dir">BSA Directory</h3>

<p>The directory contains the information needed to access the various data
records in the BSA file.  The contents of each record depends on the BSA
file.  In general, the directory gives an identification number/string and
a record length for each record.  There are two known types of directories
identified by the DirectoryType bytes in the BSA header (0x0100 and 0x0200).</p>

<div style="margin: 0px 1em;">
		<h4 id="x100">BSA 0x0100 Directory (Name)</h3>

The 0x0100 type directory consists of records 18 bytes in size and give a
record size and 13 byte name for each BSA record.
<pre>	
	[Bytes 0-13] char FileName[14];
		The filename which identifies this data section.  Filenames
		are in the usual DOS 8.3 format.
	[Bytes 14-17] long DataSize;
		The size of the data in bytes.  The first record starts at 
		offset 4 in the file, ignoring the 4 bytes of the BSA Header.
		The subsequent section offsets can be calculated from this.
</pre>

		<h4 id="x200">BSA 0x0200 Directory (Number)</h3>

The 0x0200 type directory consists of records 8 bytes in size and give a
record size and long identifier for each BSA record.
<pre>
	[Bytes 0-3] long RecordID;
		A long number which assumbly identifies the record somehow.
	[Bytes 4-7] long DataSize;
		The size of the data in bytes.  The first entry starts at 
		offset 4 in the file, ignoring the 4 bytes of the BSA Header.
		The subsequent section offsets can be calculated from this.
</pre>

<h2 id="bindices">Appendix C - BLOCK INDICES</h2>

  At offset 0x1BD97F in v2.13 FALL.EXE, there's a listing of 45 RMB files in
  the format "TVRN????.RMB" to probably be used with a printf() type function
  to generate the appropiate entry to load from BLOCKS.BSA. The filename list
  is as follows (13 bytes per record, 8.3 filenames, terminated by a NULL):
<pre>
	Index     Filename	 File Chars	File Index	Description

</pre>
<p>File chars fill in the first two ?? and the file index fills in the last two
  ??.   A value of "A/B/G, L/M/S" means the file characters could be one of
  AL, AM, AS, BL, BM, BS, GL, GM, or GS.  The descriptions given are a rough
  guess based on the RMB file name. The known values for the file chars as
  given in location post records in MAPS.BSA are shown below.</p>
<pre>
	Value	File Char
	----	--------
	0x00	  AA
	0x01	  AA
	0x02	  AA
	0x07	  AA
	0x0F	  DA
	0x11	  DA
	0x13      DA
	0x15      DA
	0x1F	  DA
	0x2F	  AL
	0x3F	  DL
	0x4F	  AM
	0x5F	  DM
	0x6F	  AS
	0x7F	  DS
	0x8F	  AA
	0x9F      DA
</pre>
  The 'D' values are strange in that there are no RMB files that have a D in
  the fifth character position.


<h2 id="limits">Appendix D - COORDINATE LIMITS</h2>

<p>Coordinates are roughly in centimeters as given in the game by using the
  ' cheat key for quest info. Coordinates are 256 times smaller than
  the coordinates used for the 3D objects.</p>
<pre>
	X = 0? (As far West as you can go)
	X = 32,400,000 (As far East as you can go on the map)
	Z = 2,000,000 (As far South as you can go on the map)
	Z = 16,367,616 (As far North as you can go)
</pre>

<h2 id="uv">Appendix E - UV TEXTURE COORDINATES</h2>

  Note: Much of this information orginated from Craig (cpeterson@ematic.com)
  and Gavin (interkarma@m0use.net, http://m0use.net/~interkarma).

<p>Daggerfall handles UV coordinates a little differently than most 3D programs
  and require some explanation.  The TextureU and TextureV in the plane sub-
  records hold the texture coordinate data for the face point but, depending
  on the face, the UV coordinates have different meaning:</p>
<pre>
	Point 1: The actual DfUV coordinate for that point.
	Point 2: The change in DfUV coordiantes relative to Point 0.  To get
		 the absolute DfUV values you must add Point 1s to Point 0.
	Point 3: The change in DfUV coordiantes relative to Point 1.  To get
		 the absolute DfUV values you must add Point 2s to Point 1
		 and 0.
	Point 4: For faces with more than 3 points, this point is the absolute
		 DF UV coordinate for that point.  Tests seem to indicate,
		 though, that the game does not use this data.
	Point 5+:UV coordinates should be all 0 and are not used.
</pre>
<p>Since all points on the face after the 4th have no UV values, this indicates
  that we must find a relationship between the XYZ point and the UV coordinate,
  which is detailed below.</p>

<p>The units of DfUV texture coordinates are relative to the size of the texture
  image.  A value of 1024 represents 64 pixels of image data. The conversion
  between DfUV and standard UV coordinates is detailed below.</p>

  
<h3>CONVERTING XYZ to UV Coordinates</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, as of this point, there is no simple way to compute the UV
  coordinate of a point from its XYZ location, but the best current method is
  explained as follows.  We first assume that the relationship is linear and
  of the form:</p>
<pre>
		U = aX + bY + cZ + d
		V = eX + fY + gZ + h
</pre>
Since all faces have at least 3 points (confirmed) and we know the UV
  coordinates for the first 4 points, we should be able to solve for the 
  parameters a...h. We assume d and h are both 0 for this case, though we
  will use them later.  We could solve for the 6 unknowns explicitly but we
  would have to take into account which points have similar XYZ coordinates 
  which becomes messy (we can't divide by X1-X2 if they are equal).  Instead, 
  we will take the similar route of expressing the equations in matrix form
  and solving the matrix equation (which may turn out to be just as complex).
  The matrix equation for U is of the form:
<pre>
	{ X1 Y1 Z1 }   { a }   { U1 }
	{ X2 Y2 Z2 } * { b } = { U2 }
	{ X3 Y3 Z3 }   { c }   { U3 }
</pre>
  where X1,Y1,Z1,U1 and the coordinates of the first points.  To solve for
  the unknown matrix {a..c} we simple need the inverse of the {X1...Z3} matrix
  which will be multiplied to left of the {U1..U3} matrix.  Using the Jacobian
  method of matrix inversion we can find the solution to be:
<pre>
		/* Compute the determinant of the XYZ matrix */
	Determinant = X1*Y2*Z3 + Y1*Z2*X3 + Z1*X2*Y3 - X3*Y2*Z1 - X2*Y1*Z3 - X1*Y3*Z2
	
		/* Compute the inverse of the XYZ matrix */
	Xi1 = ( Y2*Z3 - Y3*Z2) / Determinant
	Xi2 = (-X2*Z3 + X3*Z2) / Determinant
	Xi3 = ( X2*Y3 - X3*Y2) / Determinant

	Yi1 = (-Y1*Z3 + Y3*Z1) / Determinant
	Yi2 = ( X1*Z3 - X3*Z1) / Determinant
	Yi3 = (-X1*Y3 + X3*Y1) / Determinant

	Zi1 = ( Y1*Z2 - Y2*Z1) / Determinant
	Zi2 = (-X1*Z2 + X2*Z1) / Determinant
	Zi3 = ( X1*Y2 - X2*Y1) / Determinant

		/* Compute the DfUV conversion parameters */
  	a = U1*Xi1 + U2*Yi1 + U3*Zi1
	b = U1*Xi2 + U2*Yi2 + U3*Zi2
	c = U1*Xi3 + U2*Yi3 + U3*Zi3
	d = 0

	e = V1*Xi1 + V2*Yi1 + V3*Zi1
	f = V1*Xi2 + V2*Yi2 + V3*Zi2
	g = V1*Xi3 + V2*Yi3 + V3*Zi3
	h = 0
</pre>
  This works for more than 90% of the 10251 objects in the ARCH3D.BSA files,
  but it fails when the Determinant above is 0.  This usually occurs when all
  of the points on a face lie in the X, Y, or Z plane (ie, the X/Y/Z coordinates 
  are identical for all points in the face).  In these cases we must use the d 
  and h parameters which were previously assumed to be zero. For example, in the
  case where all Y's are equal, the equations turn into:
<pre>
	U = aX + cZ + d
	V = eX + gZ + h
</pre>
  as b and f are irrelevant due to Y=0.  The matrix solution then becomes:
<pre>
	{ X1 1 Z1 }   { a }   { U1 }
	{ X2 1 Z2 } * { d } = { U2 }
	{ X3 1 Z3 }   { c }   { U3 }

	Determinant = X1*Z3 + Z2*X3 + Z1*X2 - Z1*X3 - X2*Z3 - X1*Z2

	Xi1 = ( Z3 - Z2) / Determinant
	Xi2 = (-X2*Z3 + X3*Z2) / Determinant
	Xi3 = ( X2 - X3) / Determinant

	Yi1 = (-Z3 + Z1) / Determinant
	Yi2 = ( X1*Z3 - X3*Z1) / Determinant
	Yi3 = (-X1 + X3) / Determinant

	Zi1 = ( Z2 - Z1) / Determinant
	Zi2 = (-X1*Z2 + X2*Z1) / Determinant
	Zi3 = ( X1 - X2) / Determinant
	
	a = U1*Xi1 + U2*Yi1 + U3*Zi1
	b = 0
	c = U1*Xi2 + U2*Yi3 + U3*Zi3
	d = U1*Xi2 + U2*Yi2 + U3*Zi2

	e = V1*Xi1 + V2*Yi1 + V3*Zi1
	f = 0
	g = V1*Xi3 + V2*Yi3 + V3*Zi3
	h = V1*Xi2 + V2*Yi2 + V3*Zi2
</pre>
  using similar equations for the case of constant X and Z, we can successfully
  convert XYZ coordinates to DfUV texture coordinates for about 97% of the 
  Arch3D objects.  This still leaves arounds 270 objects where the XYZ
  determinant is zero.  All remaining objects can be solved by the following
  rules:<ul>

	<li>Ignore faces with 4 or fewer points as the face contains the direct
	  UV information for the first 4 points.</li>
	<li>Ignore faces with solid colors (textures 0 and 1).</li>
	<li>If the above cases fail to find a valid solution, attempt the remaining
	  cases for a XZ, XY, and YZ solutions (one should work).  This is due
	  to some faces having similar/identical X/Z coordinates.</li>
  </ul>	
  To convert from DfUV coordinates (computed above) into 'normal' UV, the
  following equations can be used:
<pre>
	NU = (aX + bY + cZ + d) / (16 * TextureWidth)
	NV = (eX + fY + gZ + h) / (16 * TextureHeight)
</pre>
<p>Normal UV coordinates are based on a value of 1.0 equaling the texture
  width or height and are usually used in 3D modelling programs.  These
  equations appear to give the correct texture coordinates for most 3D
  objects.</p>


<h2 id="land">Appendix F - LAND CREATION NOTES</h2>

<p>Steps to create a map 'block' or pixel.  The entire DF map is composed of 
  1000x500 land pixels, each of which is further divided into 5x5 subpixels as
  per the WOODS.WLD data.  Each pixel can contain only one town or dungeon and
  has a given terrain type, texture, and roughness.</p>
<pre>
    == All Pixels ==
	1. Generate land pixel from Woods.WLD
	2. Smooth edges with adajacent pixels
	3. Add flats to landscape (trees, bushes, rocks, etc...)
	4. Check for a location within the pixel.  Currently, the only known
	   way to do this is to check all the locations within the current
	   region.  It may be indicated by the first two bytes in a pixel
	   record in WOODS.WLD, but this is not yet confirmed
		A. Load just the maptable for the region, if not loaded
		B. Check all locations or a pixel-coordinate match
		C. Stop search on first match
    == Location Only Pixels ==
	5. Load entire location from MAPS.BSA
	6. Smooth appropiate land for location. How to get width/height for
	   location or just smooth entire pixel? Smoothing should not be
	   absolute, there should still be some random 'ripple'.  If the
 	   entire pixel is to be smoothed, this could be done in Step 1.
	6. Parse through the object list in the map record (post records)
	   	A. Load appropiate Blocks.BSA record.
		B. Parse Blocks.BSA record, create block D3D frame
			i.  Load Arch3D.BSA object
			ii. Add object to frame at required position
		C. Add block frame to land pixel frame at required position
