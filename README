 OpenScrolls
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yes, this whole source tree is ugly. It's a mix match of different
languages and is not really doing anything useful.

So here is what you'll find in this:

openscrolls_imgviewer - image viewer
openscrolls_menu - fake starting menu
openscrolls_skyviewer.py - sky viewer (SKY* files)
openscrolls_monster.py - monster reader (MONSTER.BSA file)

This is better than the last version (2 years ago), at least you don't
have to update 3 constants before using it ;)

Good luck!
