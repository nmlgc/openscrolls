Yes, this whole source tree is ugly. It's a mix match of different
languages and is not really doing anything useful.

So here is what you'll find in this:

    imgviewer       - image viewer, written in C with SDL
    menu            - fake starting menu, in C with SDL
    skyviewer.py    - sky viewer (SKY* files), Python + PyGame
    list_monster.py - monster reader (MONSTER.BSA file), Python + PyGame
    book_reader.py  - book reader, Python (Tkinter)
    font_viewer.py  - font view, Python (Tkinter)

Good luck!
